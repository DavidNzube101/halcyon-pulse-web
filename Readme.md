# Halcyon Pulse - The Solana's Continuum

## Overview
Halcyon Pulse is an idea for a proactive, predictive network monitoring tool for the Solana ecosystem. In theory, it would collect  real-time and historical network data to forecast potential disruptions. This project ide demonstrates a scalable, technically robust solution for maintaining network stability on Solana.

## Architecture
The system is structured into several KEY components:

- **Data Collection Module:**  
  Continuously gathers network performance metrics from Solana nodes using API endpoints and WebSocket streams.

- **Data Storage & Processing:**  
  Aggregates real-time and historical metrics in a time-series database to support trend analysis and anomaly detection.

- **Prediction Engine:**  
  Implements heuristic algorithms (with the potential for machine learning integration) to analyze data patterns, predict network issues before they escalate.

- **Alert & Notification System:**  
  Issues customizable alerts based on predefined thresholds and predictive signals.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  A responsive UI that visualizes real-time analytics, predictions, and alert statuses through dynamic charts and graphs.

## Technical Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  Uses event-driven architecture to efficiently poll and stream network metrics.

- **Historical Analysis:**  
  Aggregates and processes time-series data to feed into the predictive algorithms.

- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  Employs heuristic-based algorithms with scope for machine learning enhancements to forecast potential network disruptions.

- **Simulated Automated Mitigation:**  
  Demonstrates prototype-based automated response protocols for issue resolution.

- **Dynamic Visualization:**  
  Provides an interactive dashboard with smooth animations, real-time data visualization, and responsive design.
